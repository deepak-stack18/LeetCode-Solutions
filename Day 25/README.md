# Day 25 - #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Problems Solved
1. **Generate Parentheses** (LeetCode #22)
2. **Subsets** (LeetCode #78)

## Language
Java

## Topics Covered
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Combinatorics
- Bitmasking

## Key Takeaways

### Generate Parentheses
- Used recursion with constraints to ensure only well-formed parentheses are generated.
- Balanced open and close bracket counts at each step.
- Backtracking helped prune invalid paths early.

### Subsets
- Applied bitmasking to generate the power set efficiently.
- Used binary representation to decide inclusion/exclusion of elements.
- Improved understanding of combinatorics-based problems.
