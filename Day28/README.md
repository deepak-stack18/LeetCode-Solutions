# ðŸš€ #100DaysOfCode Challenge

This repository contains my daily progress in the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge, where I solve Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode using **Java**.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 29
### Problems Solved:
1. **Word Search** (LeetCode #79)  
   - Applied DFS + Backtracking to search words in a 2D grid.  
   - Learned to handle visited states by marking and restoring cells.

2. **Word Break** (LeetCode #139)  
   - Implemented recursion with prefix/suffix segmentation.  
   - Faced TLE â†’ learned importance of memoization / DP in recursive problems.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
- Backtracking is powerful but requires proper state management.  
- Recursive problems often need optimization with memoization or DP.  
- Clean helper functions improve debugging and readability.
